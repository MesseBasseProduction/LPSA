# LPSA

After using `npm install`, you'll be able to generate documentation, using `npm run doc`.
One can run a local instance, using `npm run start`. One can also run ``npm run watch` to bundle assets and watch for any change on them.

In order to perform tests, ensure that your previously run `npm run build` so bundles are computed. Tests elies on them to properly test the build.
One can then run `npm run test` for a single run, or `npm run test:dev` so the test browser doesn't get closed by the end of the testing suite.

Please refer to the generated [jsDoc](htps://messebasseproduction.github.io/LPSA/doc/index.html) for the code's documentation.
